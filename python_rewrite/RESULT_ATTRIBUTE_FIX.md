# Result Attribute Fix

## Issue
When running the `map_generator.py` script, the following error occurred:

```
AttributeError: 'MapGenerator' object has no attribute 'result'
```

## Cause
The error occurred because the `SVGGenerator` class in `svg_generator.py` was expecting the model passed to it to have a `result` attribute with a `roads` key. However, the `MapGenerator` class didn't have this attribute.

In the old implementation (commented out in `map_generator.py`), a `ModelGenerator` was created and passed to the `SVGGenerator`. The `ModelGenerator` has a `result` attribute that is populated in its `generate` method. However, in the new implementation, the `MapGenerator` itself is passed to the `SVGGenerator`, but it didn't have a `result` attribute.

## Solution
The solution was to add a `result` attribute to the `MapGenerator` class and populate it in the `generate` method, similar to how it's done in the `ModelGenerator` class:

1. Added a `result` attribute to the `MapGenerator` class, initialized as an empty dictionary:
   ```python
   self.result = {}
   ```

2. Modified the `generate` method to populate the `result` attribute with the `roads` key:
   ```python
   # 将生成的数据添加到result中，供SVGGenerator使用
   if hasattr(self, 'streamlines') and self.streamlines is not None:
       self.result['roads'] = [[(v.x, v.y) for v in line] for line in self.streamlines.allStreamlines]
   ```

3. Modified the `_generate_streamlines` method to create a dummy streamlines object with an empty `allStreamlines` attribute:
   ```python
   class DummyStreamlines:
       def __init__(self):
           self.allStreamlines = []
           
   self.streamlines = DummyStreamlines()
   ```

## Testing
After making these changes, the script runs without errors. However, since we're using a dummy streamlines object with an empty `allStreamlines` list, the generated SVG file (`map.svg`) will be empty. A full implementation would need to properly initialize the streamlines object with actual road data.

## Alternative Solutions
There were other ways to solve this issue:

1. Modify the `SVGGenerator` to not expect a `result` attribute
2. Create a `ModelGenerator` in the `MapGenerator.export_svg` method and pass that to the `SVGGenerator`

The solution implemented (adding a `result` attribute to the `MapGenerator` class) was chosen for its simplicity and directness.
