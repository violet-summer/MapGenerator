# Additional Import Error Fixes

## Issue
After fixing the initial import error in `map_generator.py`, additional import errors were found in other files:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\APP\CODE\MapGenerator\python_rewrite\map_generator.py", line 4, in <module>
    from basis_field import Grid
  File "C:\APP\CODE\MapGenerator\python_rewrite\basis_field.py", line 2, in <module>
    from .tensor import Tensor
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

## Cause
The error occurred because multiple Python files in the project were using relative imports (with a dot prefix, e.g., `from .tensor import ...`), which are only valid when the module is part of a package. When running a script directly, Python doesn't recognize it as part of a package, so relative imports fail.

## Solution
The solution was to convert all relative imports to absolute imports by removing the dot prefix in the following files:

1. `basis_field.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .tensor import Tensor
   from .vector import Vector
   
   # After
   from tensor import Tensor
   from vector import Vector
   ```

2. `tensor_field.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .basis_field import Grid, Radial
   from .polygon_util import PolygonUtil
   from .tensor import Tensor
   from .vector import Vector
   
   # After
   from basis_field import Grid, Radial
   from polygon_util import PolygonUtil
   from tensor import Tensor
   from vector import Vector
   ```

3. `tensor.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .vector import Vector
   
   # After
   from vector import Vector
   ```

4. `polygon_util.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .vector import Vector
   
   # After
   from vector import Vector
   ```

5. `streamlines.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .tensor_field import TensorField
   from .vector import Vector
   from .grid_storage import GridStorage
   from .integrator import FieldIntegrator
   
   # After
   from tensor_field import TensorField
   from vector import Vector
   from grid_storage import GridStorage
   from integrator import FieldIntegrator
   ```

6. `grid_storage.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .vector import Vector
   
   # After
   from vector import Vector
   ```

7. `integrator.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .tensor_field import TensorField
   from .vector import Vector
   from .streamlines import StreamlineParams
   
   # After
   from tensor_field import TensorField
   from vector import Vector
   from streamlines import StreamlineParams
   ```

8. `model_generator.py`:
   ```python
   # Before
   from .streamlines import StreamlineGenerator
   from .tensor_field import TensorField
   
   # After
   from streamlines import StreamlineGenerator
   from tensor_field import TensorField
   ```

## Testing
After making these changes, the import errors were resolved. When running `map_generator.py`, the script now progresses past the import stage and encounters a different error related to the implementation of the SVGGenerator and MapGenerator classes, not to the import system:

```
AttributeError: 'MapGenerator' object has no attribute 'result'
```

This confirms that our changes to fix the relative imports have worked correctly.

## Note on Circular Imports
There is a potential circular import issue between `integrator.py` and `streamlines.py`, as they import from each other. This might cause problems in some cases, but it doesn't appear to be causing issues with the current implementation.

## Alternative Solutions
As mentioned in the previous document, there are other ways to solve the import errors:

1. **Make the directory a proper package**: Create an `__init__.py` file in the `python_rewrite` directory and run the script as a module: `python -m python_rewrite.map_generator`

2. **Add the parent directory to the Python path**: Add the following at the top of the script:
   ```python
   import sys
   import os
   sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
   ```

3. **Use a relative import with importlib**: Use the `importlib` module to import the modules dynamically.

The solution implemented (converting to absolute imports) was chosen for its simplicity and directness.
